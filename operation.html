            Permissioned operation impacts the availability of the network to various
            participants, which can affect inclusivity with regard to underserved or
            vulnerable populations. Permissioned networks also expose the permission giver
            to legal or other attacks.

            Similar to Governance, financial accountability reflects the integrity and
            sustainability of the DID registry. The more open, transparent, and accountable
            the system, the greater the confidence a DID controller may have that it will
            remain stable and operational, and therefore continue to provide service.

            Does the DID Method restrict access or functionality to particular wallet

        <h5>Relevance</h5>
        <p>
            The ability to communicate with different (ideally all) resolvers and
            registries significantly increases the applicability of a decentralized
            identity layer / usability of a given wallet. Vice versa, limited capability
            to work with other Methods and registries restrict usage.

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <p>
            How much memory is required for DID resolution, without relying on authoritative
            intermediaries (e.g. blockchain explorer APIs)? We consider the amount of memory
            required to fully resolve a DID of the method, whether that memory is stored
            locally or processed ephemerally via communications.

            Whether or not one can resolve a DID directly on a resource-constrained device
            affects the granularity at which smaller devices can be part of the ecosystem.
            If small edge devices, such as a smart watch, smart speaker, or even a mobile
            phone, are incapable of directly resolving a DID of the DID Method, then the
            method will lead to cloud-based services like blockchain explorer APIs, which
            themselves become a point of centralization. Many find this option an
            acceptable engineering trade-off. Others would prefer solutions that allow
            even the smallest devices to be fully capable of resolving DIDs in an
            authoritative manner.

            Being able to create a DID in constrained situations enables certain types of
            decentralized applications that otherwise are not possible. On the edge, many
            devices rely on gateways to manage compute-, memory-, and bandwidth- intensive
            tasks. For example, while a smart lightbulb might use ZigBee or 6LowPAN, it
            will typically use a hub to connect to the Internet, even for access from
            devices within the local IP network. The more resources it takes for small
            devices to participate in registration, the greater the percentage of those
            that will need to rely on centralizing factors like hubs and gateways.

            Different Methods enable different scopes in which a DID might be considered
            usable or valid. For example, peer DIDs are only usable between the two peers
            who share unique DIDs with each other; other parties are unable to resolve the
            DID, find the DID Document, or use its information to establish secure
            interactions. In contrast, BTCR records all DIDs on a public ledger, meaning
            that all DIDs are fundamentally accessible to any party who might receive the
            DID. Contextual DIDs are a middle ground that allow a set of parties to use
            DIDs, while those outside that group cannot meaningfully do so. Finally,
            central DIDs use the DID syntax and DID Documents to establish secure
            communications, but authority to use these DIDs resides with the central party,
            who may revoke that ability at their discretion.

            Who can retrieve cryptographic proof of the history of changes to a given DID

        <p>
            Trustlessness is a prerequisite of a decentralized system. If you have to
            trust the source of a DID Document (i.e., if you can't verify
            cryptographically a DID Document that is returned from resolution), then you
            are at the mercy of a potentially centralized authority. If, instead you have
            a cryptographic audit trail, then the current state of a DID cannot be
            compromised by an intermediary or central party.
