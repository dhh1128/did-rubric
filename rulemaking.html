                Anyone can participate in an open, fair process where all participants have
                equal opportunity to be heard and influence decisions.

            <li>
                Anyone can comment and contribute to open debate, but decisions are ultimately
                made by a closed group.
            </li>
            <li>
                Debate is restricted to a selected but known group.
            </li>
            <li>
                Debate is conducted in secret by an unknown group.

            Governance determines how the rules of the underlying network are set and
            maintained. The more parties that are able to contribute to governance debates,
            the more decentralized the governance.

            While participation measures active contribution, transparency measures the
            visibility of discussions affecting rule making. If such discussions are only
            visible to a limited group, it centralizes decision making in ways that
            <a>Evaluators</a> and users cannot easily see.

            The underlying financial goals of DID Method creators may affect the
            centralization of their Method. If the goal of a Method is to enhance or
            support a certain group, then there may be centralization focused on that
            group and their interests. In the most centralized extreme, a Method may be
            created explicitly to establish a monopoly market that it can extract rent
            from. The opposite extreme is a Method created explicitly for the public good.

            Governance takes resources, which can limit the ability of interested parties
            to influence rulemaking. Generally, the more expensive it is to participate,
            the more governance centralizes to those parties most able to make the
            investment.

                    The specification is available for engagement via Github, but participating in
                    decision making takes time and requires expertise. The network and registry
                    (bitcoin) are theoretically open to any participants, but influencing the
                    direction of bitcoin is notoriously expensive and unpredictable.

                    The did:sov: method together with 100% of the Sovrin ledger and Sovrin
                    infrastructure are governed by an open public non-profit organization that is
                    open to anyone to participate. The Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group
                    is an all-volunteer community-driven effort in which over 50 volunteers have
                    participated for over three years to develop a
                    <a href="https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/">fully public governance
                        framework</a> on which anyone can comment and suggest improvements. The Sovrin
                    ledger operates on the Hyperledger Indy open source code base to which anyone
                    can contribute.

                    The specification is available for engagement via Github, and managed by DIF.
                    The network itself, Ethereum, is expensive and difficult to influence: not
                    impossible for an outsider, but expensive. Governance of the registry is not
                    accessible except with uPort's permission.

                    While the did:jolo specification is available online, it is archived and not
                    open to further engagement. Jolocom has sole control over who can participate
                    in developing specifications based on did:jolo, and they work with customers
                    to customize the Method. The network itself, Ethereum, is expensive and
                    difficult to influence: not impossible for an outsider, but expensive. The
                    registry is immutable and therefore not open to participation.
