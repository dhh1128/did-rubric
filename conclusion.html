<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    This Rubric for Decentralization of DID Methods provides one framework for
    evaluating how "decentralized" a given DID Method is. It offers a set of
    criteria which can be used selectively by <a>Evaluator</a>s to better
    understand and document their considerations when deciding to support or adopt
    a given DID Method.

    We look forward to feedback and improvements on this document and will be
    proposing it as the foundation for further development in the Decentralized
    Identifier Working Group (DID WG) of the World Wide Web Consortium. Today,
    comments are welcome in the Rebooting Web of Trust repository in which this
    document is published. Our intention is to move this conversation to the DID
    WG, should the group accept this contribution as a starting point for future
    work.
