<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>
    For each major software component (Wallet, Resolver, and <a>Registry</a>), ask
    each of the following questions. In this section, because DIDs are so early in
    the development lifecycle, most DID methods in production have only one
    implementation and some have none. Therefore, we have not standardized the
    responses nor provided examples. Consider these open-ended essay questions for
    consideration. As the market matures, this subset of questions will improve.
