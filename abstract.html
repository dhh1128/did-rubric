    The communities behind Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) bring together a
    diverse group of contributors who have decidedly different notions of exactly
    what "decentralization" means.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than attempting to resolve this potentially unresolvable question, we
    propose a rubric &mdash; a scoring guide used to evaluate performance, a
    product, or a project &mdash; that teaches how to evaluate a given DID Method
    according to one's own requirements.
</p>
<p>
    This rubric presents a set of criteria which an <a>Evaluator</a> can apply to
    any DID Method based on the use cases most relevant to them. We avoid reducing
    the Evaluation to a single number because the criteria tend to be multidimensional
    and many of the possible responses are not necessarily good or bad. It is up
    to the <a>Evaluator</a> to understand how each response in each criteria might
    illuminate favorable or unfavorable consequences for their needs.
</p>
<p>
    While this rubric allows the evaluation of many aspects of decentralization of
    a DID Method, it is not exhaustive, and does not cover other factors that may
    affect selection or adoption of a particular Method, such as privacy, security,
    reliability, or efficiency.
