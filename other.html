<h3>Other Possible Criteria</h3>
<p>
    We reviewed a lot of proposed criteria for inclusion in this rubric. Not all
    of them turned out to be a good fit, often because they were simply not related
    to decentralization. They were useful criteria for evaluating a DID Method,
    but we specifically limited ourselves to ONLY consider those criteria that
    specifically capture some notion of decentralization or its related benefits.
</p>
<p>
    We've included a list of additional considered criteria in <a href="#possible-additional-criteria"></a>.
</p>
<p>
    Maturity was one of those categories of criteria that we liked, but just
    wasn't related to how decentralized a Method is. We considered the maturity of
    the specification, such as how long it has been published. We considered the
    organizational maturity of the lead proponents of the Method: is this Method
    backed by a major player that has been around a while or is its only advocate
    a small startup? We even considered the operational maturity of the Method:
    how long had the Method been live, in production?
</p>
<p>
    These are all excellent questions to ask when considering supporting, adopting,
    or contributing to a particular DID Method, but they do not capture
    anything about how decentralized a Method is. A system simply doesn't become
    more or less centralized just because it is around a long time.
</p>
<p>
    What can happen over time is that a given Method might improve in its adoption
    or diversity, as more institutions, users, and platforms add support in
    various ways, and these aspects of a Method can shift how decentralized a
    Method might be, but maturity itself does NOT affect
    centralization.
</p>
<p>
    The authors had similar discussions considering security, privacy, and
    reliability criteria. All of these are important, but not directly related to
    the question of decentralization. While decentralization can improve
    reliability, it can also undermine it if done poorly. Similarly, security and
    privacy don't necessarily impact decentrality and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>
    We encourage everyone using this rubric to consider it as one tool for
    evaluating only the decentralization aspect of DID Methods. Other
    <a>Evaluations</a> will also be necessary to make a fully informed decision
    about adopting, supporting, or contributing to any given Method.
